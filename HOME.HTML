One App for Seamless Manufacturing Control
This new concept in manufacturing control is designed to provide an integrated yet modular approach to manufacturing control using a single comprehensive application. This approach, the brainchild of several top professionals in the field today, has been developed into a working model and is now ready to revolutionize the manufacturing control industry. The idea of this one comprehensive application has been attempted before, but failed due to varied limitations, including a lack of flexibility, high cost of implementation, and unwillingness to stray from the already established applications. Recent advancements in technology and internet infrastructure have now made it feasible to develop an application that can overcome these limitations and give a universal solution to manufacturing control.
We live in the information age, a time when data collection and information distribution drives our society. This application acknowledges this and provides an architecture to give operational visibility for all manufacturing assets. By utilizing a service-oriented architecture platform, the application integrates many different systems such as MRP, ERP, scheduling, supply chain, and others to provide an all-encompassing operational view; allowing the user to aggregate information, monitor events, measure performance, and analyse manufacturing data. Making it a truly comprehensive solution for manufacturing control.
In today's fast-paced environment, business agility is more important than ever. The ability to quickly and effectively adapt a system to the ever-changing business environment is what will separate the leaders from the followers. Businesses can no longer afford long and expensive software customization projects. This application utilizes powerful configuration tools along with out-of-the-box functionality to provide an application that is easily changeable and highly configurable at a fraction of the effort and cost of other systems.
